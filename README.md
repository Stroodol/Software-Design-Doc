# Software-Design-Doc
•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?  
The Gaming room wanted to make their Android game into a web-based game. The software needed to have more than one team, multiple players, unique names for the teams and players, and there could only be one instance of the game at any given time.   
    
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  
I believe I did well when it came time to recommend what operating system would work best for The Gaming Room. Being able to weigh the pros and cons for a client is the most important skill to have for this kind of project.       
•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?   
Designing the document allowed me to focus on what the client felt was most important. It also gave me a checklist of things that I needed to add to the code.   
     
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?   
I would like to revise the Evaluation portion of this document. I believe if I had more time, I would have been able to better go over the pros and cons of each operating system.   
    
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?   
It is important to know the user’s needs so that you can choose the best operating system for the project. This includes costs and availability. If you choose wrongly, the project might not be able to go well. 
     
•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?   
I worked on this software piece by piece. I wanted to make sure that I got everything that the client wanted there to be. I think if I ever had to make something similar to this in the future, I would try to make sure that everything worked well with what the client needed.
